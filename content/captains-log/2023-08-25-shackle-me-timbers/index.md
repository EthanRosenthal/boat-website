One thing (of the many) that my dad noticed when on Peregrine was that the square steel bolts at the transmission that hold the propeller shaft could very well come loose. The same thing could also happen to the anchor rode shackles. 

I bought some steel "seizing" wire from [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/):

>Round Bend-and-Stay Multipurpose 304 Stainless Steel Wire, Matte Finish, 1/4-lb. Spool, 0.041" Diameter [8860K15](https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/130/4290/8860K15)

I did a mediocre job of seizing the transmission.

I did a better job on the more laborious anchor shackles.

There are two anchors on the boat, a large plow and a small Danforth. The shackle for the Danforth will need to be replaced.
