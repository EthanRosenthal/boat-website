Today was the first time bringing non-family on the boat. Two of my Data friends who had never met each other joined me on Peregrine. One met me at Penn Station. The other met us on the train in Queens.

The conditions were objectively terrible. It was over 90 degrees out, and zero wind. The conditions were so calm that we spotted a sailboat that didn't even bother to anchor while a bunch of kids swam off the boat. 

While motoring out to the Sound, I noticed that we were going quite slow. I'd estimate the boat was going around 1.5 kts slower than earlier in the season at the same RPM. The GPS kept randomly turning off, and I had some trouble getting the boat into forward gear. I took some mental notes.


We motored out to the area in between Hart Island and City Island. I'd say we made it about halfway up City Island and then decided to turn around. It was hot! 

We motored back to the mooring, ate some tamales, drank some beers provided by the Queens friend. After lunch we cooled off in the water, and then made our way back home.
