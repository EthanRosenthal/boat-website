We had some friends in town, so my wife and I took 3 people out with us for the day. At 5 people total, this is the most we've fit on Peregrine. I think we could've comfortably fit 2 more. 

The weather was perfect: mid 80s and like 10 knots of wind. We sailed out to Execution Rock and then anchored by Barker Point to swim for a while. 

On our way back, I stupidly let the jib furler line fall in the water. It got caught in the prop, and the engine suddenly stopped. Thankfully, the line didn't actually get stuck in the prop; the prop clean sliced it (I dove on the prop later to confirm this). The line was now too short, so I later had to go to West Marine and buy a new one. That's a $100 mistake I won't make again!
