Welcome to the website for my 1978 Sabre 28 MKII, Peregrine. This website contains a [blog]({{< ref "captains-log" >}}) of sorts for documenting trips aboard Peregrine, as well as a collection of [resources]({{< ref "resources" >}}) so that I have a place to keep track of my knowledge of the boat.

During the sailing season, Peregrine is kept on a mooring in Port Washington, Long Island. I chose Port Washington because it seemed like the optimal location for sailing on The Sound while still providing decent access via public transportation from NYC, where I live with my wife and son.
